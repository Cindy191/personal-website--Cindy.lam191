        <p id="skill-label">Skill Description:</p>
        <p id="skill-description"> My skills are in full-stack development but more on the backend side. I have experience in creating a few full stack projects as shown on my Technical Projects section as well as completing a Software Development internship this past summer 2024. Will add more later.</p>
        <p id="technical-interest">Technical Interest in Computer Science: </p>
        <p id="technical-interest-description">I have an interest in Computer Science because I would like to build software that has an impact on people's lives whether directly or indirectly. I'd like to work in the finance or travel industry because that is where my personal interest lie and is where I see I can make the most impact while enjoying the products I build.</p>
